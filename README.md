# CHIP-8 Emulator Task:

This repo contains the required resources and test ROMs for the **CHIP-8 Emulator** task of the Web Enthusiasts Club Recruitments, 2020.

## Instructions:

The ROMs are present in the `ROMs` directory. Corresponding assembly files for these ROMs are provided in directory `ROMs/assembly_files` for reference. These assembly files were compiled into ROMs using the assembler in the repo [github.com/Byebyesky/chipper-asm](https://github.com/Byebyesky/chipper-asm).

These ROMs are constructed to utilize all the opcodes in the subset of the CHIP-8 ISA that needs to be implemented as a part of the task. So if the ROMs run as expected on the emulator, that would mean that the emulator works as intended.
